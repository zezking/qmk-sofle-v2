Where did I source the parts?

- PCB: manufactered by JLCPCB using the gerber files from the original repo. Make sure you choose the colors you want
- Top and bottom plates: Same as above. Also make sure you choose the colors you want. I chose green by accident and I'm not as mad as I thought I would be. Tried my best to match the colors with the keycaps
- keyboard switches: [MMD Matcha V3 Ice Cream Linear Keyboard Switches - 5 Pins, 53G POM, Fine Lubrication, Mechanical Keyboard Kits - Switches](https://www.temu.com/goods.html?_bg_fs=1&goods_id=601099632284006&sku_id=17592645242830&_x_sessn_id=tmovbfz5ww&refer_page_name=bgt_order_detail&refer_page_id=10045_1742357108022_4x8l5d4u64&refer_page_sn=10045) A good budget choice but a bit clicky for my taste. I would like to do some modding to make them more silent.
- keyboard sockets: [Gateron Hot-swappable PCB Socket](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002637150446.html?spm=a2g0o.order_detail.order_detail_item.5.4e9ef19cmeAxVf)
- keycaps: [Profile PBT Keycaps: 123 Keys Thermal Sublimation Matcha Green](https://www.temu.com/goods.html?_bg_fs=1&goods_id=601099565803282&sku_id=17592415216952&_x_sessn_id=tmovbfz5ww&refer_page_name=bgt_order_detail&refer_page_id=10045_1742357370351_qpzpx6xphz&refer_page_sn=10045). Will try low profile keycaps next time.
- diodies: [(100pcs) 1N4148W SOD-123 1206 SMD Switch Diode 1N4148 SOD123](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004629414782.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.51.531a1802VA8TUC)
- TRRS connectors:  [Gold Plated 3.5mm To 3.5 mm TRRS](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006954874186.html?spm=a2g0o.order_detail.order_detail_item.3.763af19c732NV2)
- M2 screws and spacers: [200Pcs/set M2 Black/White Hex Nylon Standoff Spacer](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32862529967.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.11.514a1802L2gtiv) Double check with the size. I bought the wrong size. Tried to make it work but it was a pain. Ended up buying CPU screws and standoffs from a local computer store called Memory Express.
- OLED display module: [0.91Inch OLED Display Module, I2C Interface, 128X32 LCD Screen SSD1306 Blue/White Light, 3.3V5V](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007302239124.html?spm=a2g0o.order_detail.order_detail_item.3.6204f19cTVuRRy)
- Pro Micro: [TENSTAR ROBOT Pro Micro With the Bootloader Black/Blue ATmega32U4 5V/16MHz Module Controller ](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32849563958.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.84.514a1802GQBuEG) The original repo states that you should not use arduino pro micros but I purchased them by accident and they worked fine. Maybe I am missing something here. It clearly shows the pro micro is arduino and the firmware is flashed without any issues. Do make sure you get ATmega32U4

The rest of the parts can be found mostly on Aliexpress. I will update the list if there is anything tricky to find.
