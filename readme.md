Where did I source the parts?

- PCB: manufactered by JLCPCB using the gerber files from the original repo. Make sure you choose the colors you want
- Top and bottom plates: Same as above. Also make sure you choose the colors you want. I chose green by accident and I'm not as mad as I thought I would be. Tried my best to match the colors with the keycaps
- keyboard switches: [MMD Matcha V3 Ice Cream Linear Keyboard Switches - 5 Pins, 53G POM, Fine Lubrication, Mechanical Keyboard Kits - Switches](https://www.temu.com/goods.html?_bg_fs=1&goods_id=601099632284006&sku_id=17592645242830&_x_sessn_id=tmovbfz5ww&refer_page_name=bgt_order_detail&refer_page_id=10045_1742357108022_4x8l5d4u64&refer_page_sn=10045) A good budget choice but a bit clicky for my taste. I would like to do some modding to make them more silent.
- keyboard sockets: [Gateron Hot-swappable PCB Socket](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002637150446.html?spm=a2g0o.order_detail.order_detail_item.5.4e9ef19cmeAxVf)
- keycaps: [Profile PBT Keycaps: 123 Keys Thermal Sublimation Matcha Green](https://www.temu.com/goods.html?_bg_fs=1&goods_id=601099565803282&sku_id=17592415216952&_x_sessn_id=tmovbfz5ww&refer_page_name=bgt_order_detail&refer_page_id=10045_1742357370351_qpzpx6xphz&refer_page_sn=10045). Will try low profile keycaps next time.
